# Hybrid Mobile App base on AngularJS and Cordova

This prefab is for a hybrid mobile application based on the learnings of past projects.

The technical landscape is broad, and the goal of this prefab is to make as many
mechanical technical decisions as practically possible so you can focus on the
product instead of solved problems.

# In What Context Might This Be Useful?

You need a cross-platform mobile application and don't have the time or skills (or it just doesn't make sense) to build two native applications.

# Technical Approach
